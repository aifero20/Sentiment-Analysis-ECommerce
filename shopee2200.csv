Another suggestion is to enable the option to be notified when an item is in stock again. Also, there has been too many duplicate products in which these sellers sets a much higher price for the same item and orders it from the original seller before shipping it (2 weeks ETA).

But, there's no warranties while your packages are under shipping. Unlike t*******a where is you can pay an insurance for your packages with a small amount. It's okay to buy an expensive product (> IDR 200K) but using COD methods because It's vulnerable to lost your package. Also the UI is too slow to load sometimes confusing, even you're using a high spec phone. Overall I enjoyed the promo. Hope you improve the systems by adding ""Shipping insurances"".",2,3,,9/4/2023 8:16,,

I'm used to ecommerce apps being bloated and cramped, but Shopee took it to a new level by being really unresponsive. Lack of feedback (like press indicator, haptics, loading icon, etc) and slow respons make the app felt really laggy. Especially the Shopee Food sections. Seems to me that the feature is forced to work with current Shopee app framework. I'd be glad to write suggestions, but GP review only allow 500",2,68,2.81.08,12/27/2021 20:51,,
